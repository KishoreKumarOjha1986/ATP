What Are Kubernetes Objects?
Kubernetes objects are entities provided by Kubernetes for deploying, maintaining, and scaling applications either on cloud or on-premise infrastructure.

Pods:
A pod is the most basic unit of the Kubernetes cluster. It usually contains one or more running containers. 
Pods are designed to be ephemeral in nature which means that they can be destroyed at any time. 
Containers in a pod share the same network, storage, and lifecycle. 
What this means is that they can communicate with each other directly, and will both be stopped and started at the same time.
